              Cyber Security is the process of protecting information on the
              internet from unauthorized or criminal attempts to steal private and
              personal information. The people that attempt to steal the
              information are called hackers. Some problems they could cause are
              malware erasing your entire system, altering files on your computer,
              using your computer to attack others and make it seem like you were
              the one to attack them, or an attacker stealing your credit card
              information and making unauthorized purchases.

              Now more than ever, our lives have become more and more reliant on
              technology. Whether or not that be for schooling, working, or just
              general leisure, people now more than ever use technology in their
              daily lives. But with this helpful tool also comes a very big risk.
              Hackers attempt to hack, or break into your device and steal all of
              your information. The most common thing hackers break into is your
              email. Through this email, a hacker can access anything that you have
              that email set up to, whether that be something simple like a Netflix
              Account, or something vitally important, such as a bank that you might
              use. Increasing Cyber Security usage would help prevent that from
              happening, and make sure that you're always protected.

              One of the most important ways to protect information online is
              through the use of two-factor authentication. This process makes it so
              that anytime someone tries to access something such as an email, it
              sends a notification to either the person who is registered to the
              email's phone, or to a different email address entirely. This alone
              has cut down around 99.9% of automatic attacks on different email
              addresses, making actually hacking the email much more difficult.
              Another way to protect yourself is through the use of strong
              passwords. Some people would typically put something simple to guess
              as a password, whether that be something such as Password12345 or
              something similar, which would be easy to remember, but also easy to
              guess. Instead, by using a combination of random numbers and letters,
              or a much longer password, would drastically reduce the chance of
              being hacked.
